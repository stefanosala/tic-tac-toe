===========

This is a simple Command Line Interface implemenation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.

## Requirements

You need to have a recent node version installed (it has been tested with Node v20).
Once you have that sorted just simply install dependencies:

    $ npm install

Then start the game and follow on screen instructions:

    $ npm start

## Tests

Tests are executed via `vitest` and linted via a basic and unopinionated `eslint` configuration.
You can run everything with:

    $ npm test
